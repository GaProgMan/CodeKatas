# RomanNumeralParser

This aim of this project is to create a parser which can take a `string` representing a [Roman Numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) and convert it to an `integer`. It was written using [Test-drive Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and the [Red-Green-Refactor](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2005/red-green-refactor) process.
